## Overview

Lurox AI is an open-source adaptive learning system that personalizes educational content using dynamic word embeddings and semantic profiling. The system automatically adjusts text complexity and learning paths to match individual comprehension levels.

## Key Features

- **Student Semantic Profile Builder** - Multi-dimensional learner embeddings tracking comprehension across domains
- **Dynamic Vocabulary Adjuster** - Real-time semantic substitution using BERT + word embeddings
- **Concept Dependency Mapper** - Reinforcement learning-based optimal learning path generation
- **Real-Time Adaptation Engine** - Continuous profile updates based on learner interactions
- **World Models Integration** - Predictive neural networks simulating learner comprehension patterns

## Core Technology

- **ML Stack:** PyTorch, BERT (Hugging Face), GloVe/Word2Vec (300-dim), LSTM networks
- **Databases:** Neo4j (concept graphs), MongoDB (learner profiles)
- **Infrastructure:** Apache Kafka event streaming, Python microservices

## Installation

```bash
pip install lurox
